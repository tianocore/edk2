Testing and Quality Assurance
------------------------------

Comprehensive Testing Suite
````````````````````````````

EDK II includes a comprehensive testing infrastructure with security regression tests,
unit tests, integration tests, and platform tests.

**Quick Start:**

.. code-block:: bash

  # Run all tests
  python stuart_ci_build -c .pytool/CISettings.py

  # Run security tests
  cd SecurityTests/Python && python test_command_injection.py

  # Generate coverage report
  python stuart_ci_build -c .pytool/CISettings.py --coverage

**Documentation:**

- `Testing Guide <TESTING.md>`__ - Comprehensive testing instructions
- `Testing Strategy <testing_strategy.md>`__ - Overall testing approach
- `Test Coverage Report <test_coverage.md>`__ - Current coverage and goals

Security and Quality Analysis
``````````````````````````````

Comprehensive security and code quality analysis has been performed on the EDK II codebase:

- `Security Analysis <security_analysis.md>`__ - Identified vulnerabilities and remediation
- `Code Quality Report <code_quality.md>`__ - Code quality issues and improvements

**Security Test Coverage:** All identified vulnerabilities have corresponding regression tests

**Current Test Coverage:** ~35% (Target: 80%)

**CI/CD:** Automated testing runs on all pull requests via GitHub Actions
