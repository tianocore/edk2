/**

  Initialise the serial port to the specified settings.
  All unspecified settings will be set to the default values.

  @param[in]  UartBase            The base address of the serial device.
  @param[in]  UartClkInHz         The clock in Hz for the serial device.
                                  Ignored if the PCD PL011UartInteger is not 0
  @param[in out] BaudRate         The baud rate of the serial device. If the
                                  baud rate is not supported, the speed will be
                                  reduced to the nearest supported one and the
                                  variable's value will be updated accordingly.
  @param[in out] ReceiveFifoDepth The number of characters the device will
                                  buffer on input.  Value of 0 will use the
                                  device's default FIFO depth.
  @param[in out]  Parity          If applicable, this is the EFI_PARITY_TYPE
                                  that is computed or checked as each character
                                  is transmitted or received. If the device
                                  does not support parity, the value is the
                                  default parity value.
  @param[in out]  DataBits        The number of data bits in each character.
  @param[in out]  StopBits        If applicable, the EFI_STOP_BITS_TYPE number
                                  of stop bits per character.
                                  If the device does not support stop bits, the
                                  value is the default stop bit value.

  @retval RETURN_SUCCESS            All attributes were set correctly on the
                                    serial device.
  @retval RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER  One or more of the attributes has an
                                    unsupported value.
