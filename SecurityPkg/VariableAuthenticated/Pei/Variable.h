/**
  Return the next variable name and GUID.

  This function is called multiple times to retrieve the VariableName 
  and VariableGuid of all variables currently available in the system. 
  On each call, the previous results are passed into the interface, 
  and, on return, the interface returns the data for the next 
  interface. When the entire variable list has been returned, 
  EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned.

  @param  This              A pointer to this instance of the EFI_PEI_READ_ONLY_VARIABLE2_PPI.

  @param  VariableName      On entry, a pointer to a null-terminated string that is the variable's name.
                            On return, points to the next variable's null-terminated name string.

  @param  VariableGuid      On entry, a pointer to an UEFI _GUID that is the variable's GUID. 
                            On return, a pointer to the next variable's GUID.
