                                      is the default algorithm for the driver.

                                      hardware or firmware error.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER       One or more of the parameters are incorrect.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL        The buffer RNGAlgorithmList is too small to hold the result.
