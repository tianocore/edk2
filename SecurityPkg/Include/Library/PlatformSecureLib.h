/**

  This function provides a platform-specific method to detect whether the platform
  is operating by a physically present user. 

  Programmatic changing of platform security policy (such as disable Secure Boot,
  or switch between Standard/Custom Secure Boot mode) MUST NOT be possible during
  Boot Services or after exiting EFI Boot Services. Only a physically present user
  is allowed to perform these operations.

  NOTE THAT: This function cannot depend on any EFI Variable Service since they are
  not available when this function is called in AuthenticateVariable driver.
  
  @retval  TRUE       The platform is operated by a physically present user.
  @retval  FALSE      The platform is NOT operated by a physically present user.
