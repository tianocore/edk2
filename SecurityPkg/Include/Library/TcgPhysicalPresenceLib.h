/**
  Check and execute the pending TPM request and Lock TPM.

  The TPM request may come from OS or BIOS. This API will display request information and wait
  for user confirmation if TPM request exists. The TPM request will be sent to TPM device after
  the TPM request is confirmed, and one or more reset may be required to make TPM request to
  take effect. At last, it will lock TPM to prevent TPM state change by malware.

  This API should be invoked after console in and console out are all ready as they are required
  to display request information and get user input to confirm the request. This API should also
  be invoked as early as possible as TPM is locked in this function.
