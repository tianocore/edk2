/**
  Retrieves the 64-bit frequency in Hz and the range of performance counter

  If StartValue is not NULL, then the value that the performance counter starts
  with immediately after is it rolls over is returned in StartValue. If
  EndValue is not NULL, then the value that the performance counter end with
  immediately before it rolls over is returned in EndValue. The 64-bit
  frequency of the performance counter in Hz is always returned. If StartValue
  is less than EndValue, then the performance counter counts up. If StartValue
  is greater than EndValue, then the performance counter counts down. For
  example, a 64-bit free running counter that counts up would have a StartValue
  of 0 and an EndValue of 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. A 24-bit free running counter
  that counts down would have a StartValue of 0xFFFFFF and an EndValue of 0.
