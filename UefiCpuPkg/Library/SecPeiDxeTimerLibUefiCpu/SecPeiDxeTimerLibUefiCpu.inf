# Instance of Timer Library only using CPU resources.
#
# Timer Library that only uses CPU resources to provide calibrated delays
#  on IA-32, x64, and IPF.
# Note: A driver of type DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER and DXE_SMM_DRIVER can use this TimerLib 
#  in their initialization without any issues. They only have to be careful in 
#  the implementation of runtime services and SMI handlers.  
#  Because CPU Local APIC and ITC could be programmed by OS, it cannot be
#  used by SMM drivers and runtime drivers, ACPI timer is recommended for SMM
#  drivers and runtime drivers.
#
# This library differs with the SecPeiDxeTimerLibCpu library in the MdePkg in
# that it uses the local APIC library so that it supports x2APIC mode.
