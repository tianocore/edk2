  Management Mode initialization.

  @param[in] CpuIndex   The index of the CPU to install the custom SMI handler.
                        The value must be between 0 and the NumberOfCpus field
                        in the System Management System Table (SMST).
  @param[in] SmBase     The SMBASE address for the CPU specified by CpuIndex.
  @param[in] SmiStack   The stack to use when an SMI is processed by the
                        the CPU specified by CpuIndex.
  @param[in] StackSize  The size, in bytes, if the stack used when an SMI is
                        processed by the CPU specified by CpuIndex.
  @param[in] GdtBase    The base address of the GDT to use when an SMI is
                        processed by the CPU specified by CpuIndex.
  @param[in] GdtSize    The size, in bytes, of the GDT used when an SMI is
                        processed by the CPU specified by CpuIndex.
  @param[in] IdtBase    The base address of the IDT to use when an SMI is
                        processed by the CPU specified by CpuIndex.
  @param[in] IdtSize    The size, in bytes, of the IDT used when an SMI is

  @param[in] Cr3        The base address of the page tables to use when an SMI
