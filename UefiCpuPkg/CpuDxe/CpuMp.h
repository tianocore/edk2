/**
  This service executes a caller provided function on all enabled APs. APs can
  run either simultaneously or one at a time in sequence. This service supports
  both blocking and non-blocking requests. The non-blocking requests use EFI
  events so the BSP can detect when the APs have finished. This service may only
  be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to dispatch all the enabled APs to the function specified
  by Procedure.  If any enabled AP is busy, then EFI_NOT_READY is returned
  immediately and Procedure is not started on any AP.

  If SingleThread is TRUE, all the enabled APs execute the function specified by
  Procedure one by one, in ascending order of processor handle number. Otherwise,
  all the enabled APs execute the function specified by Procedure simultaneously.

  If WaitEvent is NULL, execution is in blocking mode. The BSP waits until all
  APs finish or TimeoutInMicroseconds expires. Otherwise, execution is in non-blocking
  mode, and the BSP returns from this service without waiting for APs. If a
  non-blocking mode is requested after the UEFI Event EFI_EVENT_GROUP_READY_TO_BOOT
  is signaled, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED must be returned.

  If the timeout specified by TimeoutInMicroseconds expires before all APs return
  from Procedure, then Procedure on the failed APs is terminated. All enabled APs
  are always available for further calls to EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs()
  and EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupThisAP(). If FailedCpuList is not NULL, its
  content points to the list of processor handle numbers in which Procedure was
  terminated.

  Note: It is the responsibility of the consumer of the EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs()
  to make sure that the nature of the code that is executed on the BSP and the
  dispatched APs is well controlled. The MP Services Protocol does not guarantee
  that the Procedure function is MP-safe. Hence, the tasks that can be run in
  parallel are limited to certain independent tasks and well-controlled exclusive
  code. EFI services and protocols may not be called by APs unless otherwise
  specified.

  In blocking execution mode, BSP waits until all APs finish or
  TimeoutInMicroseconds expires.

  In non-blocking execution mode, BSP is freed to return to the caller and then
  proceed to the next task without having to wait for APs. The following
  sequence needs to occur in a non-blocking execution mode:

    -# The caller that intends to use this MP Services Protocol in non-blocking
       mode creates WaitEvent by calling the EFI CreateEvent() service.  The caller
       invokes EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs(). If the parameter WaitEvent
       is not NULL, then StartupAllAPs() executes in non-blocking mode. It requests
       the function specified by Procedure to be started on all the enabled APs,
       and releases the BSP to continue with other tasks.
    -# The caller can use the CheckEvent() and WaitForEvent() services to check
       the state of the WaitEvent created in step 1.
    -# When the APs complete their task or TimeoutInMicroSecondss expires, the MP
       Service signals WaitEvent by calling the EFI SignalEvent() function. If
       FailedCpuList is not NULL, its content is available when WaitEvent is
       signaled. If all APs returned from Procedure prior to the timeout, then
       FailedCpuList is set to NULL. If not all APs return from Procedure before
       the timeout, then FailedCpuList is filled in with the list of the failed
       APs. The buffer is allocated by MP Service Protocol using AllocatePool().
       It is the caller's responsibility to free the buffer with FreePool() service.
    -# This invocation of SignalEvent() function informs the caller that invoked
       EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs() that either all the APs completed
       the specified task or a timeout occurred. The contents of FailedCpuList
       can be examined to determine which APs did not complete the specified task
       prior to the timeout.

  @param[in]  SingleThread            If TRUE, then all the enabled APs execute
                                      the function specified by Procedure one by
                                      one, in ascending order of processor handle
                                      number.  If FALSE, then all the enabled APs
                                      execute the function specified by Procedure
                                      simultaneously.
  @param[in]  WaitEvent               The event created by the caller with CreateEvent()
                                      service.  If it is NULL, then execute in
                                      blocking mode. BSP waits until all APs finish
                                      or TimeoutInMicroseconds expires.  If it's
                                      not NULL, then execute in non-blocking mode.
                                      BSP requests the function specified by
                                      Procedure to be started on all the enabled
                                      APs, and go on executing immediately. If
                                      all return from Procedure, or TimeoutInMicroseconds
                                      expires, this event is signaled. The BSP
                                      can use the CheckEvent() or WaitForEvent()
                                      services to check the state of event.  Type
                                      EFI_EVENT is defined in CreateEvent() in
                                      the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
                                      Specification.
  @param[in]  TimeoutInMicroseconds   Indicates the time limit in microseconds for
                                      APs to return from Procedure, either for
                                      blocking or non-blocking mode. Zero means
                                      infinity.  If the timeout expires before
                                      all APs return from Procedure, then Procedure
                                      on the failed APs is terminated. All enabled
                                      APs are available for next function assigned
                                      by EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs()
                                      or EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupThisAP().
                                      If the timeout expires in blocking mode,
                                      BSP returns EFI_TIMEOUT.  If the timeout
                                      expires in non-blocking mode, WaitEvent
                                      is signaled with SignalEvent().
  @param[in]  ProcedureArgument       The parameter passed into Procedure for
                                      all APs.
  @param[out] FailedCpuList           If NULL, this parameter is ignored. Otherwise,
                                      if all APs finish successfully, then its
                                      content is set to NULL. If not all APs
                                      finish before timeout expires, then its
                                      content is set to address of the buffer
                                      holding handle numbers of the failed APs.
                                      The buffer is allocated by MP Service Protocol,
                                      and it's the caller's responsibility to
                                      free the buffer with FreePool() service.
                                      In blocking mode, it is ready for consumption
                                      when the call returns. In non-blocking mode,
                                      it is ready when WaitEvent is signaled.  The
                                      list of failed CPU is terminated by

/**
  This service lets the caller get one enabled AP to execute a caller-provided
  function. The caller can request the BSP to either wait for the completion
  of the AP or just proceed with the next task by using the EFI event mechanism.
  See EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs() for more details on non-blocking
  execution support.  This service may only be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to dispatch one enabled AP to the function specified by
  Procedure passing in the argument specified by ProcedureArgument.  If WaitEvent
  is NULL, execution is in blocking mode. The BSP waits until the AP finishes or
  TimeoutInMicroSecondss expires. Otherwise, execution is in non-blocking mode.
  BSP proceeds to the next task without waiting for the AP. If a non-blocking mode
  is requested after the UEFI Event EFI_EVENT_GROUP_READY_TO_BOOT is signaled,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED must be returned.

  If the timeout specified by TimeoutInMicroseconds expires before the AP returns
  from Procedure, then execution of Procedure by the AP is terminated. The AP is
  available for subsequent calls to EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs() and
  EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupThisAP().

                                      service.  If it is NULL, then execute in
                                      blocking mode. BSP waits until all APs finish
                                      or TimeoutInMicroseconds expires.  If it's
                                      not NULL, then execute in non-blocking mode.
                                      BSP requests the function specified by
                                      Procedure to be started on all the enabled
                                      APs, and go on executing immediately. If
                                      all return from Procedure or TimeoutInMicroseconds
                                      expires, this event is signaled. The BSP
                                      can use the CheckEvent() or WaitForEvent()
                                      services to check the state of event.  Type
                                      EFI_EVENT is defined in CreateEvent() in
                                      the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
                                      Specification.
  @param[in]  TimeoutInMicroseconds   Indicates the time limit in microseconds for
                                      APs to return from Procedure, either for
                                      blocking or non-blocking mode. Zero means
                                      infinity.  If the timeout expires before
                                      all APs return from Procedure, then Procedure
                                      on the failed APs is terminated. All enabled
                                      APs are available for next function assigned
                                      by EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs()
                                      or EFI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupThisAP().
                                      If the timeout expires in blocking mode,
                                      BSP returns EFI_TIMEOUT.  If the timeout
                                      expires in non-blocking mode, WaitEvent
                                      is signaled with SignalEvent().
  @param[in]  ProcedureArgument       The parameter passed into Procedure for
                                      all APs.
  @param[out] Finished                If NULL, this parameter is ignored.  In
                                      blocking mode, this parameter is ignored.
                                      In non-blocking mode, if AP returns from
                                      Procedure before the timeout expires, its
                                      content is set to TRUE. Otherwise, the
                                      value is set to FALSE. The caller can
                                      determine if the AP returned from Procedure
                                      by evaluating this value.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             In blocking mode, specified AP finished before
                                  the timeout expires.
