#  Executes TPM 2.0 requests from OS or BIOS
#
#  This library will check and execute TPM 2.0 request from OS or
#  BIOS. The request may ask for user confirmation before
#  execution. It is a clone of
#  "SecurityPkg/Library/DxeTcg2PhysicalPresenceLib" with:
#
#  - removed all the functions that are unreachable from
#    Tcg2PhysicalPresenceLibProcessRequest() [called from platform
#    BDS], or SubmitRequestToPreOSFunction() and
#    ReturnOperationResponseToOsFunction() [called from Tcg2Dxe].
#
#  - replaced everything that's related to the
#    TCG2_PHYSICAL_PRESENCE*_VARIABLE variables, with direct access to
#    the QEMU structures.
#
#  Caution: This module requires additional review when modified.
#  This driver will have external input - variable.
#  This external input must be validated carefully to avoid security issue.
