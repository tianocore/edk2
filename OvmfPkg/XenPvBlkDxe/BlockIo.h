  @param  Lba        The starting Logical Block Address to read from
  @param  BufferSize Size of Buffer, must be a multiple of device block size.
  @param  Buffer     A pointer to the destination buffer for the data. The caller is
                     responsible for either having implicit or explicit ownership of the buffer.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The data was read correctly from the device.

  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA          There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED     The MediaId does not match the current device.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE   The Buffer was not a multiple of the block size of the device.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER The read request contains LBAs that are not valid,
                                or the buffer is not on proper alignment.
