/**
  Relocate the SMBASE on a hot-added CPU. Then pen the hot-added CPU in the

  this function.

  If the OS maliciously boots the hot-added CPU ahead of letting the ACPI CPU
  hotplug event handler broadcast the CPU hotplug MMI, then the hot-added CPU
  returns to the OS rather than to the pen, upon RSM. In that case, this
  function will hang forever (unless the OS happens to signal back through the
  last byte of the pen page).

  @param[in] ApicId      The APIC ID of the hot-added CPU whose SMBASE should
                         be relocated.

  @param[in] Smbase      The new SMBASE address. The root MMI handler is
                         responsible for passing in a free ("unoccupied")

                         PiSmmCpuDxeSmm in CPU_HOT_PLUG_DATA.

  @param[in] PenAddress  The address of the Post-SMM Pen for hot-added CPUs, as
                         returned by SmbaseAllocatePostSmmPen(), and installed
                         by SmbaseReinstallPostSmmPen().

                                 SMM.

  @retval EFI_PROTOCOL_ERROR     Synchronization bug encountered around
                                 FIRST_SMI_HANDLER_CONTEXT.ApicIdGate.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  Smbase does not fit in 32 bits. No relocation
