/*
 * Start of day structure passed to PVH guests and to HVM guests in %ebx.
 *
 * NOTE: nothing will be loaded at physical address 0, so a 0 value in any
 * of the address fields should be treated as not present.
 *
 *  0 +----------------+
 *    | magic          | Contains the magic value XEN_HVM_START_MAGIC_VALUE
 *    |                | ("xEn3" with the 0x80 bit of the "E" set).
 *  4 +----------------+
 *    | version        | Version of this structure. Current version is 1. New
 *    |                | versions are guaranteed to be backwards-compatible.
 *  8 +----------------+
 *    | flags          | SIF_xxx flags.
 * 12 +----------------+
 *    | nr_modules     | Number of modules passed to the kernel.
 * 16 +----------------+
 *    | modlist_paddr  | Physical address of an array of modules
 *    |                | (layout of the structure below).
 * 24 +----------------+
 *    | cmdline_paddr  | Physical address of the command line,
 *    |                | a zero-terminated ASCII string.
 * 32 +----------------+
 *    | rsdp_paddr     | Physical address of the RSDP ACPI data structure.
 * 40 +----------------+
 *    | memmap_paddr   | Physical address of the (optional) memory map. Only
 *    |                | present in version 1 and newer of the structure.
 * 48 +----------------+
 *    | memmap_entries | Number of entries in the memory map table. Zero
 *    |                | if there is no memory map being provided. Only
 *    |                | present in version 1 and newer of the structure.
 * 52 +----------------+
 *    | reserved       | Version 1 and newer only.
 * 56 +----------------+
 *
 * The layout of each entry in the module structure is the following:
 *
 *  0 +----------------+
 *    | paddr          | Physical address of the module.
 *  8 +----------------+
 *    | size           | Size of the module in bytes.
 * 16 +----------------+
 *    | cmdline_paddr  | Physical address of the command line,
 *    |                | a zero-terminated ASCII string.
 * 24 +----------------+
 *    | reserved       |
 * 32 +----------------+
 *
 * The layout of each entry in the memory map table is as follows:
 *
 *  0 +----------------+
 *    | addr           | Base address
 *  8 +----------------+
 *    | size           | Size of mapping in bytes
 * 16 +----------------+
 *    | type           | Type of mapping as defined between the hypervisor
 *    |                | and guest. See XEN_HVM_MEMMAP_TYPE_* values below.
 * 20 +----------------|
 *    | reserved       |
 * 24 +----------------+
 *
 * The address and sizes are always a 64bit little endian unsigned integer.
 *
 * NB: Xen on x86 will always try to place all the data below the 4GiB
 * boundary.
 *
 * Version numbers of the hvm_start_info structure have evolved like this:
 *
 * Version 0:  Initial implementation.
 *
 * Version 1:  Added the memmap_paddr/memmap_entries fields (plus 4 bytes of
 *             padding) to the end of the hvm_start_info struct. These new
 *             fields can be used to pass a memory map to the guest. The
 *             memory map is optional and so guests that understand version 1
 *             of the structure must check that memmap_entries is non-zero
 *             before trying to read the memory map.
