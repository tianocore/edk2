EDK_3871: Non-Compatible: klu2
	
	Class_PIEnable[1]: Use new entry point for PeiCore defined in PI specification.
	
	Code Change:
	1) Remove the definition and library instance for OldPeiCoreEntryPoinLib
	
	Possible Impacts:
	1) Platform should select MdePkg/Library/PeiCoreEntryPoint/PeiCoreEntryPoint.inf for 
	   PeiMain module.
	2) The SecCore module should provide parameters for new entry point defined in 
	   MdePkg\Include\Library\PeiCoreEntryPoint.h


EDK_3922:  Non-Compatible: qwang12, klu2
  Class_PIEnable[0]:  Update PeiServicesLib based on new features defined in PI spec.

      Code Change :
      1) Add the following services:PeiServicesRegisterForShadow, PeiServicesFfsGetFileInfo, PeiServicesFfsFindFileByName and PeiServicesFfsGetVolumeInfo
      2) The paramter list of these functiuon has also been updated to replace EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_HEADER to EFI_PEI_FV_HANDLE and EFI_FFS_FILE_HEADER
         to EFI_PEI_FILE_HANDLE.
      3) Add CONST to parameter of PeiServices EFI_PEI_SERVICES.EFI_PEI_RESET_SYSTEM

      Possible Impacts:

      1) Platform code should be updated to make use of these new PI features. The functions in MdePkg/Include/Library/PeiServicesLib.h are 
         recommended as PeiServices is saved for every PEI Services API invokation.
      2) Now PEIM entry point is upadted to pass in PeiServices in type of (CONST EFI_PEI_SERVICS **). Platform code should be updated to 
         add (EFI_PEI_SERVICS **) cast to PeiServices before passing it to the previously defined PPI interface which needs a (EFI_PEI_SERVICS **)
         type for PeiServices parameter.
      3) The newly defined PPI should not inlcude PeiSevices in the paramter list as PI spec has standard way to retrive PeiServices (check VOL 1
         Section 4.4 PEI Sevices Table Retrieval) for details. Beside, GetPeiServicesTablePointer() in MdePkg\Include\Library\PeiServicesTablePointerLib.h
         also provide convinient way to retrieve the pointer to Pei Service Table.
