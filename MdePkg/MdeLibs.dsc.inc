!ifndef CUSTOM_STACK_CHECK_LIB
  # The DSC parser will set any unset macros to 0. Then, below when we check for STATIC or DYNAMIC, even if we couch
  # that in a !ifdef CUSTOM_STACK_CHECK_LIB, the parser will issue a warning that we are comparing a boolean (0) against
  # a string, which will always fail. So we set it to a dummy value here.
