/**
  Transfers control to a function starting with a new stack.

  Transfers control to the function specified by EntryPoint using the new stack
  specified by NewStack and passing in the parameters specified by Context1 and
  Context2. Context1 and Context2 are optional and may be NULL. The function
  EntryPoint must never return.

  If EntryPoint is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If NewStack is NULL, then ASSERT().

  @param  EntryPoint  A pointer to function to call with the new stack.
  @param  Context1    A pointer to the context to pass into the EntryPoint
                      function.
  @param  Context2    A pointer to the context to pass into the EntryPoint
                      function.
  @param  NewStack    A pointer to the new stack to use for the EntryPoint
                      function.
