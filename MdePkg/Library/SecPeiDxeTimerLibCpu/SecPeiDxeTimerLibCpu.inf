# Instance of Timer Library only using CPU resources.
#
# Timer Library that only uses CPU resources to provide calibrated delays
#  on IA-32, x64, and IPF.
# Note: Because CPU Local APIC and ITC could be programmed by OS, it cannot be
#  used by SMM drivers and runtime drivers, ACPI timer is recommended for SMM
#  drivers and runtime drivers.
