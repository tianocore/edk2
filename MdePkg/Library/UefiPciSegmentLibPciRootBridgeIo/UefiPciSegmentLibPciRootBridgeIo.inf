# PCI Segment Library that layers on top of the PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol.
#
# This library produces the APIs from the PCI Library and implements these APIs
#  by calling into the PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocols that are present in the platform.
#  The PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocols are typically produced by a chipset specific DXE driver.
#  This library binds to all of the PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocols in the platform and handles
#  the translation from a PCI segment number into a specific PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol.
