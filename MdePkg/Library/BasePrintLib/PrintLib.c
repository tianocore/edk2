  Produces a Null-terminated ASCII string in an output buffer based on a Null-terminated
  Unicode format string and  variable argument list.
  
  Produces a Null-terminated ASCII string in the output buffer specified by StartOfBuffer
  and BufferSize.
  The ASCII string is produced by parsing the format string specified by FormatString.
  Arguments are pulled from the variable argument list based on the contents of the 
  format string.
  The number of ASCII characters in the produced output buffer is returned not including
  the Null-terminator.
  If BufferSize is 0, then no output buffer is produced and 0 is returned.

  If BufferSize > 0 and StartOfBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If BufferSize > 0 and FormatString is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If BufferSize > 0 and FormatString is not aligned on a 16-bit boundary, then ASSERT().
  If PcdMaximumUnicodeStringLength is not zero, and FormatString contains more than
  PcdMaximumUnicodeStringLength Unicode characters not including the Null-terminator, then
  ASSERT().
  If PcdMaximumAsciiStringLength is not zero, and produced Null-terminated ASCII string
  contains more than PcdMaximumAsciiStringLength ASCII characters not including the
  Null-terminator, then ASSERT().

/**
  Converts a decimal value to a Null-terminated ASCII string.
  
  Converts the decimal number specified by Value to a Null-terminated ASCII string 
  specified by Buffer containing at most Width characters. No padding of spaces 
  is ever performed.
  If Width is 0 then a width of  MAXIMUM_VALUE_CHARACTERS is assumed.
  The number of ASCII characters in Buffer is returned not including the Null-terminator.
  If the conversion contains more than Width characters, then only the first Width
  characters are returned, and the total number of characters required to perform
  the conversion is returned.
  Additional conversion parameters are specified in Flags.  
  The Flags bit LEFT_JUSTIFY is always ignored.
  All conversions are left justified in Buffer.
  If Width is 0, PREFIX_ZERO is ignored in Flags.
  If COMMA_TYPE is set in Flags, then PREFIX_ZERO is ignored in Flags, and commas
  are inserted every 3rd digit starting from the right.
  If RADIX_HEX is set in Flags, then the output buffer will be 
  formatted in hexadecimal format.
  If Value is < 0 and RADIX_HEX is not set in Flags, then the fist character in Buffer is a '-'.
  If PREFIX_ZERO is set in Flags and PREFIX_ZERO is not being ignored, 
  then Buffer is padded with '0' characters so the combination of the optional '-' 
  sign character, '0' characters, digit characters for Value, and the Null-terminator
  add up to Width characters.
  
  If Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If unsupported bits are set in Flags, then ASSERT().

  @param  Value   The 64-bit signed value to convert to a string.

                  the Null-terminator.
