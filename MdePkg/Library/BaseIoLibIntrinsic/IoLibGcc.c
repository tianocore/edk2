/** @file
  I/O Library. This file has compiler specifics for GCC as there is no
  ANSI C standard for doing IO.

  GCC - uses EFIAPI assembler. __asm__ calls GAS. __volatile__ makes sure the
  compiler puts the assembler in this exact location. The complex GNUC
  operations are not optimzed. It would be possible to also write these
  with EFIAPI assembler.

  We don't advocate putting compiler specifics in libraries or drivers but there
  is no other way to make this work.
