  I/O Library. This file has compiler specifics for Microsft C as there is no
  ANSI C standard for doing IO.

  MSC - uses intrinsic functions and the optimize will remove the function call
  overhead.

  We don't advocate putting compiler specifics in libraries or drivers but there
  is no other way to make this work.
