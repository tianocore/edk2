# Memory Allocation Library instance dedicated to MM Core.
# The implementation borrows the MM Core Memory Allocation services as the primitive
# for memory allocation instead of using MM System Table servces in an indirect way.
# It is assumed that this library instance must be linked with MM Core in this package.
