Routine Description:

  The compression routine.

Arguments:

  SrcBuffer   - The buffer storing the source data
  SrcSize     - The size of source data
  DstBuffer   - The buffer to store the compressed data
  DstSize     - On input, the size of DstBuffer; On output,
                the size of the actual compressed data.

Returns:

  EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  - The DstBuffer is too small. In this case,
                DstSize contains the size needed.
  EFI_SUCCESS           - Compression is successful.
  EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  - No resource to complete function.
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - Parameter supplied is wrong.
