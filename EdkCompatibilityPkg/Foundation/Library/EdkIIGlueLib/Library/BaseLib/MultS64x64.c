/**
  Multiples a 64-bit signed integer by a 64-bit signed integer and generates a
  64-bit signed result.

  This function multiples the 64-bit signed value Multiplicand by the 64-bit
  signed value Multiplier and generates a 64-bit signed result. This 64-bit
  signed result is returned.

  If the result overflows, then ASSERT().

  @param  Multiplicand  A 64-bit signed value.
  @param  Multiplier    A 64-bit signed value.

  @return Multiplicand * Multiplier
