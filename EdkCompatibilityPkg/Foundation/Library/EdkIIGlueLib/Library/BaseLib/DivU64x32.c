/**
  Divides a 64-bit unsigned integer by a 32-bit unsigned integer and generates
  a 64-bit unsigned result.

  This function divides the 64-bit unsigned value Dividend by the 32-bit
  unsigned value Divisor and generates a 64-bit unsigned quotient. This
  function returns the 64-bit unsigned quotient.

  If Divisor is 0, then ASSERT().

  @param  Dividend  A 64-bit unsigned value.
  @param  Divisor   A 32-bit unsigned value.

  @return Dividend / Divisor
