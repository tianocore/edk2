/**

  Prints a debug message to the debug output device if the specified error level is enabled.

  If any bit in ErrorLevel is also set in PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel, then print 
  the message specified by Format and the associated variable argument list to 
  the debug output device.

  If Format is NULL, then ASSERT().

  @param  ErrorLevel  The error level of the debug message.
  @param  Format      Format string for the debug message to print.

/**

  Prints an assert message containing a filename, line number, and description.  
  This may be followed by a breakpoint or a dead loop.

  Print a message of the form "ASSERT <FileName>(<LineNumber>): <Description>\n" 
  to the debug output device.  If DEBUG_PROPERTY_ASSERT_BREAKPOINT_ENABLED bit of 
  PcdDebugProperyMask is set then CpuBreakpoint() is called. Otherwise, if 
  DEBUG_PROPERTY_ASSERT_DEADLOOP_ENABLED bit of PcdDebugProperyMask is set then 
  CpuDeadLoop() is called.  If neither of these bits are set, then this function 
  returns immediately after the message is printed to the debug output device.
  DebugAssert() must actively prevent recusrsion.  If DebugAssert() is called while
  processing another DebugAssert(), then DebugAssert() must return immediately.

  If FileName is NULL, then a <FileName> string of "(NULL) Filename" is printed.

  If Description is NULL, then a <Description> string of "(NULL) Description" is printed.

  @param  FileName     Pointer to the name of the source file that generated the assert condition.
  @param  LineNumber   The line number in the source file that generated the assert condition
  @param  Description  Pointer to the description of the assert condition.

/**

  Fills a target buffer with PcdDebugClearMemoryValue, and returns the target buffer.

  This function fills Length bytes of Buffer with the value specified by 
  PcdDebugClearMemoryValue, and returns Buffer.

  If Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().

  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS ? Buffer + 1), then ASSERT(). 

  @param   Buffer  Pointer to the target buffer to fill with PcdDebugClearMemoryValue.
  @param   Length  Number of bytes in Buffer to fill with zeros PcdDebugClearMemoryValue.
