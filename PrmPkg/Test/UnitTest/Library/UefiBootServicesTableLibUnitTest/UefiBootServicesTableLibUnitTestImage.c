/**
  Loads an EFI image into memory and returns a handle to the image.

  @param  BootPolicy              If TRUE, indicates that the request originates
                                  from the boot manager, and that the boot
                                  manager is attempting to load FilePath as a
                                  boot selection.
  @param  ParentImageHandle       The caller's image handle.
  @param  FilePath                The specific file path from which the image is
                                  loaded.
  @param  SourceBuffer            If not NULL, a pointer to the memory location
                                  containing a copy of the image to be loaded.
  @param  SourceSize              The size in bytes of SourceBuffer.
  @param  ImageHandle             Pointer to the returned image handle that is
                                  created when the image is successfully loaded.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The image was loaded into memory.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND           The FilePath was not found.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   One of the parameters has an invalid value.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED         The image type is not supported, or the device
                                  path cannot be parsed to locate the proper
                                  protocol for loading the file.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES    Image was not loaded due to insufficient
                                  resources.
  @retval EFI_LOAD_ERROR          Image was not loaded because the image format was corrupt or not
                                  understood.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR        Image was not loaded because the device returned a read error.
  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED       Image was not loaded because the platform policy prohibits the
                                  image from being loaded. NULL is returned in *ImageHandle.
  @retval EFI_SECURITY_VIOLATION  Image was loaded and an ImageHandle was created with a
                                  valid EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL. However, the current
                                  platform policy specifies that the image should not be started.
