  @param[in, out] ImageInfoSize      A pointer to the size, in bytes, of the ImageInfo buffer.
                                     On input, this is the size of the buffer allocated by the caller.
                                     On output, it is the size of the buffer returned by the firmware
                                     if the buffer was large enough, or the size of the buffer needed
                                     to contain the image(s) information if the buffer was too small.
  @param[in, out] ImageInfo          A pointer to the buffer in which firmware places the current image(s)
                                     information. The information is an array of EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTORs.

                                     associated with the EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR.

                                     that package version update is in progress.

/**
  Updates the firmware image of the device.

  This function updates the hardware with the new firmware image.
  This function returns EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the firmware image is not updatable.
  If the firmware image is updatable, the function should perform the following minimal validations
  before proceeding to do the firmware image update.
  - Validate the image authentication if image has attribute
    IMAGE_ATTRIBUTE_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED. The function returns
    EFI_SECURITY_VIOLATION if the validation fails.
  - Validate the image is a supported image for this device. The function returns EFI_ABORTED if
    the image is unsupported. The function can optionally provide more detailed information on
    why the image is not a supported image.
  - Validate the data from VendorCode if not null. Image validation must be performed before
    VendorCode data validation. VendorCode data is ignored or considered invalid if image
    validation failed. The function returns EFI_ABORTED if the data is invalid.

  VendorCode enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update policy. Null if
  the caller did not specify the policy or use the default policy. As an example, vendor can implement
  a policy to allow an option to force a firmware image update when the abort reason is due to the new
  firmware image version is older than the current firmware image version or bad image checksum.
  Sensitive operations such as those wiping the entire firmware image and render the device to be
  non-functional should be encoded in the image itself rather than passed with the VendorCode.
  AbortReason enables vendor to have the option to provide a more detailed description of the abort
  reason to the caller.

  @param[in]  This               A pointer to the EFI_FIRMWARE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  ImageIndex         A unique number identifying the firmware image(s) within the device.

  @param[in]  ImageSize          Size of the new image in bytes.
  @param[in]  VendorCode         This enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update policy.
                                 Null indicates the caller did not specify the policy or use the default policy.
  @param[in]  Progress           A function used by the driver to report the progress of the firmware update.
  @param[out] AbortReason        A pointer to a pointer to a null-terminated string providing more
                                 details for the aborted operation. The buffer is allocated by this function
