/**
  Extracts the attached content from a PKCS#7 signed data if existed. The input signed
  data could be wrapped in a ContentInfo structure.

  Return FALSE to indicate this interface is not supported.

  @param[in]   P7Data       Pointer to the PKCS#7 signed data to process.
  @param[in]   P7Length     Length of the PKCS#7 signed data in bytes.
  @param[out]  Content      Pointer to the extracted content from the PKCS#7 signedData.
                            It's caller's responsibility to free the buffer with FreePool().
  @param[out]  ContentSize  The size of the extracted content in bytes.

  @retval     TRUE          The P7Data was correctly formatted for processing.
  @retval     FALSE         The P7Data was not correctly formatted for processing.
