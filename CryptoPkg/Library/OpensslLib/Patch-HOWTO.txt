                                 Introduction
================================================================================
  OpenSSL is a well-known open source implementation of SSL and TLS protocols.
The core library implements the basic cryptographic functions and provides various
utility functions. The OpenSSL library is widely used in variety of security 
products development as base crypto provider. (See http://www.openssl.org for more 
information for OpenSSL).
  UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a specification detailing the 
interfaces between OS and platform firmware. Several security features were 
introduced (e.g. Authenticated Variable Service, Driver Signing, etc) from UEFI 
2.2 (http://www.uefi.org). These security features highly depends on the 
cryptography. This patch will enable openssl building under UEFI environment.

                                OpenSSL-Version
================================================================================
  Current supported OpenSSL version for UEFI Crypto Library is 0.9.8w.

================================================================================
                      HOW to Install Openssl for UEFI Building
================================================================================
1.  Download OpenSSL 0.9.8w from official website:
   	http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8w.tar.gz

    NOTE: Some web browsers may rename the downloaded TAR file to openssl-0.9.8w.tar.tar.
          When you do the download, rename the "openssl-0.9.8w.tar.tar" to
          "openssl-0.9.8w.tar.gz" or rename the local downloaded file with ".tar.tar"
          extension to ".tar.gz".

2.  Extract TAR into CryptoPkg/Library/OpenSslLib/openssl-0.9.8w

    NOTE: If you use WinZip to unpack the openssl source in Windows, please 
          uncheck the WinZip smart CR/LF conversion option (WINZIP: Options --> 
          Configuration --> Miscellaneous --> "TAR file smart CR/LF conversion").
  
3.  Apply this patch: EDKII_openssl-0.9.8w.patch, and make installation

    For Windows Environment:
    ------------------------
    1) Make sure the patch utility has been installed in your machine.
       Install Cygwin or get the patch utility binary from 
          http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm
    2) cd $(WORKSPACE)\CryptoPkg\Library\OpensslLib\openssl-0.9.8w
    3) patch -p0 -i ..\EDKII_openssl-0.9.8w.patch
    4) cd ..
    5) Install.cmd

    For Linux* Environment:
    -----------------------
    1) Make sure the patch utility has been installed in your machine.
       Patch utility is available from http://directory.fsf.org/project/patch/
    2) cd $(WORKSPACE)/CryptoPkg/Library/OpensslLib/openssl-0.9.8w
    3) patch -p0 -i ../EDKII_openssl-0.9.8w.patch
    4) cd ..
    5) ./Install.sh
