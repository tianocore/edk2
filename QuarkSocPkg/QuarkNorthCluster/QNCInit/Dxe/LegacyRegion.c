  Modify the hardware to allow (decode) or disallow (not decode) memory reads in a region.

  If the On parameter evaluates to TRUE, this function enables memory reads in the address range
  Start to (Start + Length - 1).
  If the On parameter evaluates to FALSE, this function disables memory reads in the address range
  Start to (Start + Length - 1).
