/**
  Rotates a 32-bit integer left between 0 and 31 bits, filling the low bits
  with the high bits that were rotated.

  This function rotates the 32-bit value Operand to the left by Count bits. The
  low Count bits are fill with the high Count bits of Operand. The rotated
  value is returned.

  If Count is greater than 31, then ASSERT().

  @param  Operand The 32-bit operand to rotate left.
  @param  Count   The number of bits to rotate left.

  @return Operand <<< Count
