  No parameter checking is performed on the 5 input parameters, but there are

  address passed to PAL as buffers for return parameters must be 8-byte aligned.
  Unaligned addresses may cause undefined results.  For those parameters defined
  as reserved or some fields defined as reserved must be zero filled or the invalid
  argument return value may be returned or undefined result may occur during the
  execution of the procedure.  If the PalEntryPoint  does not point to a valid
  PAL entry point then the system behavior is undefined.  This function is only

  Disables the 32-bit paging mode on the CPU.

  Disables the 32-bit paging mode on the CPU and returns to 32-bit protected
  mode. This function assumes the current execution mode is 32-paged protected
  mode. This function is only available on IA-32. After the 32-bit paging mode
  is disabled, control is transferred to the function specified by EntryPoint
  using the new stack specified by NewStack and passing in the parameters
  specified by Context1 and Context2. Context1 and Context2 are optional and
  may be NULL. The function EntryPoint must never return.

  If the current execution mode is not 32-bit paged mode, then ASSERT().
  If EntryPoint is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If NewStack is NULL, then ASSERT().

  There are a number of constraints that must be followed before calling this
  function:
  1)  Interrupts must be disabled.
  2)  The caller must be in 32-bit paged mode.
  3)  CR0, CR3, and CR4 must be compatible with 32-bit paged mode.
  4)  CR3 must point to valid page tables that guarantee that the pages for
      this function and the stack are identity mapped.

  @param  EntryPoint  A pointer to function to call with the new stack after
                      paging is disabled.
  @param  Context1    A pointer to the context to pass into the EntryPoint
                      function as the first parameter after paging is disabled.
  @param  Context2    A pointer to the context to pass into the EntryPoint
                      function as the second parameter after paging is
                      disabled.
  @param  NewStack    A pointer to the new stack to use for the EntryPoint
                      function after paging is disabled.
