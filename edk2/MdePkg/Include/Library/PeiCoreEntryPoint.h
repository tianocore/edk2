  @param SecCoreData    Points to a data structure containing
                        information about the PEI core's
                        operating environment, such as the size
                        and location of temporary RAM, the stack
                        location and the BFV location. The type
                        EFI_SEC_PEI_HAND_OFF is

  @param PpiList        Points to a list of one or more PPI
                        descriptors to be installed initially by
                        the PEI core. An empty PPI list consists
                        of a single descriptor with the end-tag
                        EFI_PEI_PPI_DESCRIPTOR_TERMINATE_LIST.
                        As part of its initialization phase, the
                        PEI Foundation will add these SEC-hosted
                        PPIs to its PPI database such that both
                        the PEI Foundation and any modules can
                        leverage the associated service calls
                        and/or code in these early PPIs.
