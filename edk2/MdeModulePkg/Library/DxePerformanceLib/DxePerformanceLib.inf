#/** @file
#  Performance library instance used in DXE phase.
#  
#  This library instance provides infrastructure for DXE phase drivers to log performance
#  data. It consumes Performance Protocol published by DxeCorePerformanceLib
#  to log performance data. If Performance Protocol is not available, it does not log any
#  performance information.
