/**
  _plat__GetPlatformManufactureData

  This function allows the platform to provide a small amount of data to be
  stored as part of the TPM's PERSISTENT_DATA structure during manufacture.
  Of course the platform can store data separately as well,
  but this allows a simple platform implementation to store
  a few bytes of data without implementing a multi-layer storage system.
  This function is called on manufacture and CLEAR.
  The buffer will contain the last value provided
  to the Core library.

  @param[out]  PlatformPersistentData          Platform data.
  @param[in]   Size                            Size of PlatformPersistentData.
