=== EDKII RISC-V Virtual Package OVERVIEW ===

The RISC-V virtual package project is RISC-V UEFI port on EDKII OVMF package.
The binary built from RiscVVirtPkg can be lanuched on QEMU for emulating RISC-V ISA.

More information about UEFI can be found at http://www.tianocore.org
More information about OVMF can be found at http://www.tianocore.org/ovmf/
More information about RISC-V can be found at http://riscv.org

=== STATUS ===

Current capabilities:
  Current implementation can boot UEFI to internal shell.

* We preserved the capability of supporting RISC-V 32/64/128 arch
* Currently we only have the implementation of RISC-V 64 arch
* ACPI, SMBIOS, SMM and MP are not yet supported.
* QEMU RISC-V port
  - Video, USB keyboard
* Only GCC can build RISC-V arch

=== FUTURE PLANS ===

* Implement ACPI, MP, SMBIO and SMM for RISC-V.

=== BUILDING RiscVVirtPkg ===

Pre-requisites:
* Build environment capable of build the edk2 MdeModulePkg.
* GCC
  GCC RISC-V port can be found at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
  More information for building GCC RISC-V port can be found at http://riscv.org/download.html#tab_gnu-toolchain
* QEMU
  QEMU RISC-V port can be found at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu.
  More information for building QEMU RISC-V port can be found at http://riscv.org/download.html#tab_qemu

***For RISC-V UEFI port, we made some modifications on both GCC tool chain and QEMU RISC-V port base on above official links.
   Those chanegs are not reviewed and committed to the corresponding repository yet.

Update Conf/target.txt ACTIVE_PLATFORM for RiscVVirtPkg:
  * RiscVVirtPkg/RiscVVirt64.fdf
  * RiscVVirtPkg/RiscVVirt64.dsc
  * RiscVVirtPkg/RiscVVirtPkg.dec

ACTIVE_PLATFORM       = RiscVVirtPkg/RiscVVirt64.dsc
TARGET                = DEBUG
TARGET_ARCH           = RISCV64
TOOL_CHAIN_TAG        = GCC52RISCV

You can build RiscVVirtPkg through EDKII "build" under prompt.
You can build RiscVVirtPkg with debug serial port message under prompt
  build -D DEBUG_ON_SERIAL_PORT

=== RUNNING RiscVVirtPkg on QEMU ===
* Once your RiscVVirtPkg is built, you can find the flash device RISCVVIRT.fd under FV/ directory.
* After QEMU RISC-V port is built. You can find the executable file qemu-system-riscvpcat under
  YourQEMU/riscv-qemu/riscvpcat-softmmu.
* copy RISCVVIRT.fd to YourQEMU/riscv-qemu/riscvpcat-softmmu and launch RISCVVIRT.fd as below,
  ./qemu-system-riscvpcat -bios RISCVVIRT.fd -usb -usbdevice keyboard
* You can assign serial port to QEMU platform and have the debug messages output to terminal (like gdkterm).
  ./qemu-system-riscvpcat -bios -serial /dev/pts/8 RISCVVIRT.fd -usb -usbdevice keyboard
