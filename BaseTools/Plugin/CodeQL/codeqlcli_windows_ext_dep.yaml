## @file codeqlcli_windows_ext_dep.yaml
#
# Downloads the Windows CodeQL Command-Line Interface (CLI) application.
#
# This download only supports Windows. In an environment where a platform might build in different operating
# systems, it is recommended to set the scope for the appropriate CodeQL external dependency based on the
# host operating system being used.
#
# ****VERSION UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS****
#
# When updating the CodeQL CLI used here, update the corresponding codeql/cpp-queries version in CodeQlQueries.qls.
# Visit the `qlpack.yml` in the release branch for the CodeQL CLI to get the version to use there. For example, the
# CodeQL CLI 2.17.3 file is https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/codeql-cli-2.17.3/cpp/ql/src/qlpack.yml and the
# pack version there is 0.9.12.
