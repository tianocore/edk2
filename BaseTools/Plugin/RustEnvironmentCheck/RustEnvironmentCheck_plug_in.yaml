# Build plugin used to check that the users environment is ready to build with the Rust tools
# commonly used. This provides direct feedback early in the build process rather than ambiguous
# hard to find messages later during code compilation.
#
# This plugin requires the "rust-ci" scope to be set which is used in the plugins to determine
# when a workspace is building code that includes Rust.
