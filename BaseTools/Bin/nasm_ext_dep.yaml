# Download nasm from a NuGet feed.
#
# Note:
# - The NuGet package contains different binaries for different host OSes.
#
# The versioning scheme for this nasm package is as follows:
#
# - Major version of the NuGet package encodes nasm's major and minor version (nasm_major * 10000 + nasm_minor).
# - Minor version represents the nasm revision number.
# - Revision tracks the NuGet package’s own revision (number of pushes).
#
# For example, nasm version 2.16.1 becomes 20016.1.x, where x increments with each push.
