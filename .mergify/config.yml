# Mergify YML file that automatically merges a GitHub pull request against
# edk2-ci if all of the GitHub branch protections have passed.  It also
# contains rules to:
# * auto close branches that are not from an EDK II Maintainer
# * post a comment on pull requests that have merge conflicts.
# * post a comment on pull requests that have PatchCheck.py errors.
#
# Configuration Notes:
# * Update the 'base=edk2-ci' statements with the name of the branch to merge
#   pull requests.
#
# * Update the 'status-failure' statement with the name of the name of the Azure
#   Pipelines Build that performs the EDK II Maintainer check.
#
# * This file must be checked into the 'default' branch of a repo.  Copies
#   of this file on other branches of a repo are ignored by Mergify.
