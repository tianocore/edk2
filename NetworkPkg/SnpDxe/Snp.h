/**
  Manages the multicast receive filters of a network interface.

  This function is used enable and disable the hardware and software receive
  filters for the underlying network device.
  The receive filter change is broken down into three steps:
  * The filter mask bits that are set (ON) in the Enable parameter are added to
    the current receive filter settings.
  * The filter mask bits that are set (ON) in the Disable parameter are subtracted
    from the updated receive filter settings.
  * If the resulting receive filter setting is not supported by the hardware a
    more liberal setting is selected.
  If the same bits are set in the Enable and Disable parameters, then the bits
  in the Disable parameter takes precedence.
  If the ResetMCastFilter parameter is TRUE, then the multicast address list
  filter is disabled (irregardless of what other multicast bits are set in the
  Enable and Disable parameters). The SNP->Mode->MCastFilterCount field is set
  to zero. The Snp->Mode->MCastFilter contents are undefined.
  After enabling or disabling receive filter settings, software should verify
  the new settings by checking the Snp->Mode->ReceiveFilterSettings,
  Snp->Mode->MCastFilterCount and Snp->Mode->MCastFilter fields.
  Note: Some network drivers and/or devices will automatically promote receive
    filter settings if the requested setting can not be honored. For example, if
    a request for four multicast addresses is made and the underlying hardware
    only supports two multicast addresses the driver might set the promiscuous
    or promiscuous multicast receive filters instead. The receiving software is
    responsible for discarding any extra packets that get through the hardware
    receive filters.
    Note: Note: To disable all receive filter hardware, the network driver must
      be Shutdown() and Stopped(). Calling ReceiveFilters() with Disable set to
      Snp->Mode->ReceiveFilterSettings will make it so no more packets are
      returned by the Receive() function, but the receive hardware may still be
      moving packets into system memory before inspecting and discarding them.
      Unexpected system errors, reboots and hangs can occur if an OS is loaded
      and the network devices are not Shutdown() and Stopped().
  If ResetMCastFilter is TRUE, then the multicast receive filter list on the
  network interface will be reset to the default multicast receive filter list.

/**
  Places a packet in the transmit queue of a network interface.

  This function places the packet specified by Header and Buffer on the transmit
  queue. If HeaderSize is nonzero and HeaderSize is not equal to
  This->Mode->MediaHeaderSize, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be returned. If
  BufferSize is less than This->Mode->MediaHeaderSize, then EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
  will be returned. If Buffer is NULL, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be
  returned. If HeaderSize is nonzero and DestAddr or Protocol is NULL, then
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be returned. If the transmit engine of the network
  interface is busy, then EFI_NOT_READY will be returned. If this packet can be
  accepted by the transmit engine of the network interface, the packet contents
  specified by Buffer will be placed on the transmit queue of the network
  interface, and EFI_SUCCESS will be returned. GetStatus() can be used to
  determine when the packet has actually been transmitted. The contents of the
  Buffer must not be modified until the packet has actually been transmitted.
  The Transmit() function performs nonblocking I/O. A caller who wants to perform
  blocking I/O, should call Transmit(), and then GetStatus() until the
  transmitted buffer shows up in the recycled transmit buffer.
  If the driver has not been initialized, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned.

  @param This       A pointer to the EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param HeaderSize The size, in bytes, of the media header to be filled in by the

                    be equal to This->Mode->MediaHeaderSize and the DestAddr and
                    Protocol parameters must not be NULL.
  @param BufferSize The size, in bytes, of the entire packet (media header and
                    data) to be transmitted through the network interface.
  @param Buffer     A pointer to the packet (media header followed by data) to be
                    transmitted. This parameter cannot be NULL. If HeaderSize is
                    zero, then the media header in Buffer must already be filled
                    in by the caller. If HeaderSize is nonzero, then the media
                    header will be filled in by the Transmit() function.
  @param SrcAddr    The source HW MAC address. If HeaderSize is zero, then this
                    parameter is ignored. If HeaderSize is nonzero and SrcAddr
                    is NULL, then This->Mode->CurrentAddress is used for the

  @param DestAddr   The destination HW MAC address. If HeaderSize is zero, then
                    this parameter is ignored.
  @param Protocol   The type of header to build. If HeaderSize is zero, then this

/**
  Receives a packet from a network interface.

  This function retrieves one packet from the receive queue of a network interface.
  If there are no packets on the receive queue, then EFI_NOT_READY will be
  returned. If there is a packet on the receive queue, and the size of the packet
  is smaller than BufferSize, then the contents of the packet will be placed in
  Buffer, and BufferSize will be updated with the actual size of the packet.
  In addition, if SrcAddr, DestAddr, and Protocol are not NULL, then these values
  will be extracted from the media header and returned. EFI_SUCCESS will be
  returned if a packet was successfully received.
  If BufferSize is smaller than the received packet, then the size of the receive
  packet will be placed in BufferSize and EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL will be returned.
  If the driver has not been initialized, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned.

  @param This       A pointer to the EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param HeaderSize The size, in bytes, of the media header received on the network
                    interface. If this parameter is NULL, then the media header size
                    will not be returned.
  @param BufferSize On entry, the size, in bytes, of Buffer. On exit, the size, in
                    bytes, of the packet that was received on the network interface.
  @param Buffer     A pointer to the data buffer to receive both the media
                    header and the data.
  @param SrcAddr    The source HW MAC address. If this parameter is NULL, the HW
                    MAC source address will not be extracted from the media header.
  @param DestAddr   The destination HW MAC address. If this parameter is NULL,
                    the HW MAC destination address will not be extracted from
                    the media header.
  @param Protocol   The media header type. If this parameter is NULL, then the
                    protocol will not be extracted from the media header. See
                    RFC 1700 section "Ether Types" for examples.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The received data was stored in Buffer, and
                                BufferSize has been updated to the number of
                                bytes received.
  @retval EFI_NOT_STARTED       The network interface has not been started.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY         No packets have been received on the network interface.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  BufferSize is too small for the received packets.
                                BufferSize has been updated to the required size.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One or more of the following conditions is TRUE:
                                * The This parameter is NULL
                                * The This parameter does not point to a valid
                                  EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL structure.
                                * The BufferSize parameter is NULL
                                * The Buffer parameter is NULL
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The command could not be sent to the network interface.
