  @param[in]   ConnectStateChanged        The tag to tell if the connection state has been changed, only

/**
  This function allows the caller to request the current
  configuration for one or more named elements. The resulting
  string is in <ConfigAltResp> format. Any and all alternative
  configuration strings shall also be appended to the end of the
  current configuration string. If they are, they must appear
  after the current configuration. They must contain the same
  routing (GUID, NAME, PATH) as the current configuration string.
  They must have an additional description indicating the type of
  alternative configuration the string represents,
  "ALTCFG=<StringToken>". That <StringToken> (when
  converted from Hex UNICODE to binary) is a reference to a
  string in the associated string pack.

  @param This       Points to the EFI_HII_CONFIG_ACCESS_PROTOCOL.

  @param Request    A null-terminated Unicode string in
                    <ConfigRequest> format. Note that this
                    includes the routing information as well as
                    the configurable name / value pairs. It is
                    invalid for this string to be in
                    <MultiConfigRequest> format.
                    If a NULL is passed in for the Request field,
                    all of the settings being abstracted by this function
                    will be returned in the Results field.  In addition,
                    if a ConfigHdr is passed in with no request elements,
                    all of the settings being abstracted for that particular
                    ConfigHdr reference will be returned in the Results Field.

  @param Progress   On return, points to a character in the
                    Request string. Points to the string's null
                    terminator if request was successful. Points
                    to the most recent "&" before the first
                    failing name / value pair (or the beginning
                    of the string if the failure is in the first
                    name / value pair) if the request was not
                    successful.

  @param Results    A null-terminated Unicode string in
                    <MultiConfigAltResp> format which has all values
                    filled in for the names in the Request string.
                    String to be allocated by the called function.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The Results string is filled with the
                                  values corresponding to all requested
                                  names.

  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES    Not enough memory to store the
                                  parts of the results that must be
                                  stored awaiting possible future
                                  protocols.

  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND           Routing data doesn't match any
                                  known driver. Progress set to the
                                  first character in the routing header.
                                  Note: There is no requirement that the
                                  driver validate the routing data. It
                                  must skip the <ConfigHdr> in order to
                                  process the names.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   Illegal syntax. Progress set
                                  to most recent "&" before the
                                  error or the beginning of the
                                  string.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   Unknown name. Progress points
                                  to the & before the name in
                                  question.

/**
  This function applies changes in a driver's configuration.
  Input is a Configuration, which has the routing data for this
  driver followed by name / value configuration pairs. The driver
  must apply those pairs to its configurable storage. If the
  driver's configuration is stored in a linear block of data
  and the driver's name / value pairs are in <BlockConfig>
  format, it may use the ConfigToBlock helper function (above) to
  simplify the job.

  @param This           Points to the EFI_HII_CONFIG_ACCESS_PROTOCOL.

  @param Configuration  A null-terminated Unicode string in
                        <ConfigString> format.

  @param Progress       A pointer to a string filled in with the
                        offset of the most recent '&' before the
                        first failing name / value pair (or the
                        beginn ing of the string if the failure
                        is in the first name / value pair) or
