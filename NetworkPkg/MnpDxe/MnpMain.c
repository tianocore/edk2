/**
  Sets or clears the operational parameters for the MNP child driver.

  The Configure() function is used to set, change, or reset the operational
  parameters for the MNP child driver instance. Until the operational parameters
  have been set, no network traffic can be sent or received by this MNP child
  driver instance. Once the operational parameters have been reset, no more
  traffic can be sent or received until the operational parameters have been set
  again.
  Each MNP child driver instance can be started and stopped independently of
  each other by setting or resetting their receive filter settings with the
  Configure() function.
  After any successful call to Configure(), the MNP child driver instance is
  started. The internal periodic timer (if supported) is enabled. Data can be
  transmitted and may be received if the receive filters have also been enabled.
  Note: If multiple MNP child driver instances will receive the same packet
  because of overlapping receive filter settings, then the first MNP child
  driver instance will receive the original packet and additional instances will
  receive copies of the original packet.
  Note: Warning: Receive filter settings that overlap will consume extra
  processor and/or DMA resources and degrade system and network performance.

/**
  Polls for incoming data packets and processes outgoing data packets.

  The Poll() function can be used by network drivers and applications to
  increase the rate that data packets are moved between the communications
  device and the transmit and receive queues.
  Normally, a periodic timer event internally calls the Poll() function. But, in
  some systems, the periodic timer event may not call Poll() fast enough to
  transmit and/or receive all data packets without missing packets. Drivers and
  applications that are experiencing packet loss should try calling the Poll()
  function more often.

  @param[in]  This         Pointer to the EFI_MANAGED_NETWORK_PROTOCOL instance.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS      Incoming or outgoing data was processed.
  @retval EFI_NOT_STARTED  This MNP child driver instance has not been

  @retval EFI_NOT_READY    No incoming or outgoing data was processed. Consider
                           increasing the polling rate.
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT      Data was dropped out of the transmit and/or receive
                           queue. Consider increasing the polling rate.
