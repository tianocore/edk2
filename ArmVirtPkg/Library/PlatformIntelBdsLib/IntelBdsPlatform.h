/**
  Download the kernel, the initial ramdisk, and the kernel command line from
  QEMU's fw_cfg. Construct a minimal SimpleFileSystem that contains the two
  image files, and load and start the kernel from it.

  The kernel will be instructed via its command line to load the initrd from
  the same Simple FileSystem.

  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         Kernel image was not found.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  Memory allocation failed.
  @retval EFI_PROTOCOL_ERROR    Unterminated kernel command line.
