// This module produces the Metronome Architectural Protocol on top of Timer Library.
//
// This is a generic implementation of the Metronome Architectural Protocol that
// layers on top of an instance of the Timer Library.  The Timer Library provides
// functions for nanosecond and microsecond delays.  This generic implementation
// produces a fixed TickPeriod of 100ns unit, and when the WaitForTick() service
// is called, the number of ticks passed in is converted to either nanosecond or
// microsecond units.  If the number of ticks is small, then nanoseconds are used.
// If the number of ticks is large, then microseconds are used.  This prevents
// overflows that could occur for long delays if only nanoseconds were used and also
// provides the greatest accuracy for small delays.
